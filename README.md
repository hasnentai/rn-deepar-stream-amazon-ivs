```

### Other Required Steps

#### Android

1. Open your project's `AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following lines:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

<!-- optionally, if you want to record audio: -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

2. Update your `minSdkVersion` version minimum `23`, `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` version minimum `31` from `android/build.gradle` file, like below:

```diff
buildscript {
    ext {
        buildToolsVersion = "29.0.3"
-        minSdkVersion = 20
-        compileSdkVersion = 30
-        targetSdkVersion = 30
+        minSdkVersion = 23
+        compileSdkVersion = 31
+        targetSdkVersion = 31
    }
}
```

##### Proguard

If you're using Proguard, make sure to add rules below:

```
-keepclassmembers class ai.deepar.ar.DeepAR { *; }
-keepclassmembers class ai.deepar.ar.core.videotexture.VideoTextureAndroidJava { *; }
-keep class ai.deepar.ar.core.videotexture.VideoTextureAndroidJava
```

#### iOS

1. Open your project's `Info.plist` and add the following lines:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) needs access to your Camera.</string>

<!-- optionally, if you want to record audio: -->
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) needs access to your Microphone.</string>
```

2. Open your `ios/YourProject.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and update your iOS version to `11.0` minimum, like below:

| Setting iOS Version from Xcode                                                                  |

| Follow steps in the picture.                                                                                | Follow steps in the picture.                                                                                |

**Note:** Don't forget install Pods for iOS and rebuild your app.

### Requesting Permissions

You need to ask necessary permissions before render the DeepAR component.

#### Getting Permissions

Simply use the get functions to find out if a user has granted or denied permission before:

```jsx
import {Camera} from 'react-native-deepar';

// ..

const cameraPermission = await Camera.getCameraPermissionStatus();
const microphonePermission = await Camera.getMicrophonePermissionStatus();
```

A permission status can have the following values:

- `authorized`: Your app is authorized to use said permission. Continue with using the `<DeepAR>` view.
- `not-determined`: Your app has not yet requested permission from the user. Continue by calling the request functions.
- `denied`: Your app has already requested permissions from the user, but was explicitly denied. You cannot use the request functions again, but you can use the [Linking API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking#opensettings) to redirect the user to the Settings App where he can manually grant the permission.
- `restricted`: (iOS only) Your app cannot use the Camera or Microphone because that functionality has been restricted, possibly due to active restrictions such as parental controls being in place.

#### Requesting Permissions

Use the request functions to prompt the user to give your app permission to use the Camera or Microphone.

```jsx
import {Camera} from 'react-native-deepar';

// ..

const cameraPermission = await Camera.requestCameraPermission();
const microphonePermission = await Camera.requestMicrophonePermission();
```

- `authorized`: Your app is authorized to use said permission. Continue with using the `<DeepAR>` view.
- `denied`: The user explicitly denied the permission request alert. You cannot use the request functions again, but you can use the [Linking API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking#opensettings) to redirect the user to the Settings App where he can manually grant the permission.

## Installing AR Models

1. Put your AR models into a desired destination
2. Create `react-native.config.js` like below:

```js
module.exports = {
  assets: ['./assets/effects'], // <-- example destination
};
```

3. Add a NPM script like below:

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
+   "asset": "./node_modules/.bin/react-native-copy-asset"
  }
}
```

4. Run the script to link your AR models

```sh
npm run asset
```

**Note:** If you remove an AR model, you can run the same command for unlinking removed asset.

## Using AR Models over Internet

You don't have to install AR models in your app, you can use AR models over Internet.

1. Install [rn-fetch-blob](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob) to your project
2. You can use AR models over internet like below:

```tsx
import RNFetchBlob from 'rn-fetch-blob';

RNFetchBlob.config({
  fileCache: true,
})
  .fetch('GET', 'http://betacoins.magix.net/public/deepar-filters/8bitHearts')
  .then((res) => {
    deepARRef?.current?.switchEffectWithPath({
      path: res.path(),
      slot: 'effect',
    });
  });
```

## Usage

Make registration to DeepAR and get an API key from [Developer Panel](https://developer.deepar.ai/).

```tsx
import React, {useRef} from 'react';
import DeepAR, {IDeepARHandle} from 'react-native-deepar';

const App = () => {
  const deepARRef = useRef<IDeepARHandle>(null);

  return (
    <DeepAR
      ref={deepARRef}
      apiKey="your-api-key"
      style={{flex: 1}}
      onInitialized={() => {
        // ..
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

## API

The `<DeepAR>` component can take a number of inputs to customize it as needed. They are outlined below:

| apiKey      | string          | undefined             | <b>true</b>  | Make registration to DeepAR and get an API key from [Developer Panel](https://developer.deepar.ai/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| position    | CameraPositions | CameraPositions.FRONT | <b>false</b> | Camera position, back and front. You can change in real-time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| videoWarmup | boolean         | false                 | <b>false</b> | If set to true, changes how `startRecording` and `resumeRecording` methods work; `startRecording` method will no longer start the video recording immediately, instead it triggers `onVideoRecordingPrepared` event. You can start video recording with `resumeRecording` after `onVideoRecordingPrepared` event triggered. **Note:** Only available in iOS |

### Events

These are various events that you can hook into and fire functions on in the component:

| changeParameterFloat   | (<b>params</b>: IChangeParamaterFloat)   | This method allows the user to change the value of blendshape parameters during runtime.                                                                                                                                               |
| changeParameterVec4    | (<b>params</b>: IChangeParamaterVec4)    | This method is used to change the certain color of a Game Object at runtime.                                                                                                                                                           |
| changeParameterVec3    | (<b>params</b>: IChangeParamaterVec3)    | This method is used to change the transform of a Game Object at runtime, so here you can change the object position, rotation or scale.                                                                                                |
| changeParameterBool    | (<b>params</b>: IChangeParamaterBool)    | Let say you want to put a button in your app that enables or disables Game Object at runtime. (let's say you want your filter character to put their glasses on or take them off) This function helps you to enable/disable the value. |
| changeParameterString  | (<b>params</b>: IChangeParamaterString)  | Change a string parameter on a game object. The most common use for this override is to change blend mode and culling mode properties of a game object. **Note:** Only available in iOS                                                |
| changeParameterTexture | (<b>params</b>: IChangeParamaterTexture) | This method allows the user to load an image and set it as a texture during runtime.

| pause                       | <div align="center">-</div>  | Pauses the rendering. This method will not release any resources and should be used only for temporary pause (e.g. user goes to the next screen).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| resume                      | <div align="center">-</div>  | Resumes the rendering if it was previously paused, otherwise doesn't do anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| setLiveMode                 | (<b>enabled</b>: boolean)    | This is an optimization method and it allows the user to indicate the DeepAR in which mode it should operate. If called with true value, DeepAR will expect a continuous flow of new frames and it will optimize its inner processes for such workload. An example of this is the typical use case of processing the frames from the camera stream. If called with false it will optimize for preserving resources and memory by pausing the rendering after each processed frame. A typical use case for this is when the user needs to process just one image. |
| setFaceDetectionSensitivity | (<b>sensitivity</b>: number) | This method allows the user to change face detection sensitivity. The sensitivity parameter can range from 0 to 3, where 0 is the fastest but might not recognize smaller (further away) faces, and 3 is the slowest but will find smaller faces. By default, this parameter is set to 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| showStats                   | (<b>enabled</b>: boolean)    | Display debugging stats on screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| requestCameraPermission       | <div align="center">-</div> | Promise<`CameraPermissionRequestResult`> | Shows a "request permission" alert to the user, and resolves with the new camera permission status. If the user has previously blocked the app from using the camera, the alert will not be shown and `"denied"` will be returned.         |
| requestMicrophonePermission   | <div align="center">-</div> | Promise<`CameraPermissionRequestResult`> | Shows a "request permission" alert to the user, and resolves with the new microphone permission status. If the user has previously blocked the app from using the microphone, the alert will not be shown and `"denied"` will be returned. |
| getCameraPermissionStatus     | <div align="center">-</div> | Promise<`CameraPermissionStatus`>        | Gets the current Camera Permission Status. Check this before mounting the Camera to ensure the user has permitted the app to use the camera.                                                                                               |
| getMicrophonePermissionStatus | <div align="center">-</div> | Promise<`CameraPermissionStatus`>        | Gets the current Microphone-Recording Permission Status. Check this before mounting the Camera to ensure the user has permitted the app to use the microphone.                                                                             |

## Background Segmentation

DeepAR has [Background Segmentation](https://www.deepar.ai/background-removal) feature, with this feature you can change your background in real-time.

| Background Segmentation Preview                                                                   |

| This image taken from DeepAR offical site.                                                        |

There is a filter called `Background` from [Free Filter Pack](https://help.deepar.ai/en/articles/3580432-free-filter-pack) and you can use this filter.

**How change background image?**

Switch the `Background` effect and apply new background image like below:

```tsx
import {TextureSourceTypes} from 'react-native-deepar';
import RNFetchBlob from 'rn-fetch-blob';

RNFetchBlob.config({})
  .fetch('GET', 'https://random.imagecdn.app/450/800')
  .then((res) => {
    deepARRef?.current?.changeParameterTexture({
      gameObject: 'Background',
      component: 'MeshRenderer',
      parameter: 's_texColor',
      type: TextureSourceTypes.BASE64,
      value: res.base64(),
    });
  });
```

## Face Painting

You can detect touches in your effects if the effect customized for detecting touches. For an example; DeepAR has a filter called Face Painting, with this effect you can paint your face in real-time with touches.

For more details about face painting effect read this article [here](https://help.deepar.ai/en/articles/5608765-face-painting-effect-tutorial).

| Face Painting Preview                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img src="./docs/images/face-painting.jpeg" alt="Face Painting" width="500" /> |
| This image taken from DeepAR offical site.                                     |

If you want to be able to detect touches on the screen, you need to use the following code:

```tsx
// If you switch to the face painting effect, use below code to ability detect touches over DeepAR view
deepARRef?.current?.setTouchMode(true);

// If you not use face painting effect, use below code to disable detecting touches over DeepAR view
deepARRef?.current?.setTouchMode(false);
```
